                    The lack of incorporation of medical history in current sepsis 
                    risk prediction tools leaves a gap in the reality of sepsis 
                    development and the ability of a machine learning model to 
                    mimic this process. Inspired by the finding of Zador et al. (2019), 
                    which challenges the current diagnostic system by emphasizing the 
                    significance of interplay between pre-existing diseases in a 
                    patient’s sepsis development, we decided to create a comprehensive 
                    sepsis risk assessment dashboard that unlike other prediction tools 
                    capitalizes on our new insights relating to comorbidity. Our dashboard 
                    aims to categorize ICU patients into risk categories based on comorbidity 
                    specific vitals and convey this categorization with relevant JIT information 
                    to facilitate sepsis risk assessment for medical professionals.

                Prevalent problems in healthcare like sepsis and a progressively aging 
                population necessitates a data-driven approach for these increasingly complex problems. 
                Contemporary medical diagnoses utilize risk assessment scoring systems, such as the 
                Sepsis-related Organ Failure Score (SOFA) and the Oxford Acute Severity Illness Score (OASIS), 
                which often only focus on measured physiological data at admission. As the population ages and 
                the prevalence of multimorbidity (the combination of multiple chronic illnesses at once) increases, 
                it is becoming more evident that current medical practices need to evolve. Current medical education,
                treatment protocols, and clinical trial designs continue to maintain a singular disease focus, which 
                may contribute to the mortality rate in clinical trials and sepsis patients. The authors of the paper 
                we are replicating use grouping methods like latent class analysis to find subgroups of patients in the
                critical care dataset, arguing that a more nuanced understanding of multimorbidity could shift the thinking 
                in healthcare from a single-disease focus to a multimorbidity focused healthcare model.

                    For the Quarter 1 project, we replicated the research paper, Multimorbidity states associated with 
                    higher mortality rates in organ dysfunction and sepsis: a data driven analysis in critical care 
                    Zador et al. 2019. To familiarize ourselves with the medical domain, especially multimorbidity 
                    related to sepsis and organ dysfunction. To understand the definition of some medical terminologies, 
                    we took a look at some reference papers that are listed at the end of the research paper. The role of 
                    infection and comorbidity: Factors that influence disparities in sepsis helped us to understand the 
                    effects of sepsis and causes of morbidity. The paper was a great starting block in order to understand 
                    how different demographics and more importantly chronic medical conditions may affect the reaction time 
                    of sepsis as well as how the disease might spread and how high the mortality rate may be.
                    Researchers on the Zador et al. paper mention their motivation to create this study being the lack of studies 
                    that intertwine with sepsis and underlying diseases, despite the fact that epidemiological studies have found 
                    evidence of the two being associated. They mention that most risk assessment scores of mortality primarily focus 
                    on inpatient physiological data recorded after a patient is admitted, i.e. vital signs, respiratory monitoring, gas 
                    blood data, glucose monitoring, etc. that can only be documented after the patient is admitted to the ICU. However, 
                    the researchers found that more recent epidemiological studies state a significant effect from pre-existing conditions 
                    on mortality due to sepsis. Therefore, the risk assessment scores created using only inpatient physiological data are 
                    limited in their scope of predicting mortality in sepsis.

                    <h1 class="text-1xl text-left font-bold">Data Processing/Cleaning and EDA</h1> <br>
                    We began our Exploratory Data Analysis with a systemic extraction of patient vital sign data 
                    from the MIMIC III database where each of the vitals signs was distributed across 17 distinct 
                    “chartevents” tables. After extracting all the available vitals for temperature, respiratory rate, 
                    heart rate, blood pressure, white blood cell count, and oxygen saturation from the chartevents tables
                    we assess the viability of the data. After cleaning and assessing outliers, we conducted EDA to explore
                    the distributions of demographics and vitals amongst all patients vs each subgroup. Visual analyses display 
                    that patients with shared comorbidity profiles do differ from the overall data, indicating that splitting 
                    the vitals data by subgroup is bound to affect the model.

                    <h1 class="text-1xl text-left font-bold">Statistical Analysis</h1> <br>
                    Starting with selecting cohorts, similar to the Quarter 1 project, we focused on patients aged 16 years or older, 
                    but expanded our dataset to include patients with readmissions. We utilized Latent Class Analysis (LCA) to identify 
                    an optimal number of distinct subgroups within the patient population based on their morbidity profiles. To determine 
                    the optimal number of subgroups, we conducted LCA for a range of classes from 5 to 12, and selected the model with the 
                    lowest Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) values. This led to the identification 
                    of 7 as the optimal number of subgroups, where both AIC and BIC decreased most significantly, indicating the best fit with 
                    the data while maintaining the model’s simplicity. 
                    After the subgroup analysis, we performed logistic regression analyses to explore characteristics and relationships between 
                    morbidities within each group. This allowed us to uncover significant associations, such as the high correlation between congestive 
                    heart failure and specific comorbidities within certain subgroups.
                    For further analysis of the differences between identified subgroups, we conducted the Kruskal-Wallis test, comparing the 
                    median Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores across the subgroups. The SOFA score was chosen as our variable of 
                    interest due to its relevance in assessing the extent of a patient’s organ failure. The results of our Kruskal-Wallis test show 
                    the significant differences between the subgroups, leading us to reject the null hypothesis (p-value = 0 < 0.05) that the median 
                    severity scores across subgroups are equal. 

                    Finally, we performed a post-hoc analysis to conduct pairwise comparisons between the subgroups. This involves calculating the standardized 
                    test statistics using the Z test for each comparison and adjusting p-values for multiple comparisons to control family-wise error rates. 
                    These adjusted p-values statistically significant differences between media SOFA scores of the subgroups, which further validates the distinct
                     nature of the subgroups identified in our analysis.

                        <h1 class="text-1xl text-left font-bold">Model</h1> <br>
                        We decided to create two machine learning algorithms to help what the sepsis risk of a patient 
                        is based on what their vitals are, 
                        their subgroup, and how long they’ve been in the hospital. 
                        The first model is meant to properly place a patient in a subgroup based on their comorbidity composition. 
                        This means that based on their elixhauser scores (which diseases they have) we place them in a specific subgroup. The reasoning 
                        behind this is that disease prevalence of a patient is very correlated to their sepsis risk. When talking to medical professionals,
                        we noticed this is something they do not take into account. When analyzing whether they are sepsis prone doctors usually just look at 
                        their vitals and whether they have recently been in surgery. So our first machine learning model takes the subgroups that Latent Class Analysis
                        places patients in and uses that composition of their morbidities to predict what subgroup they are in. This machine learning model gave us a 92% accuracy rate. 

                        The second machine learning model is what helped us predict whether a patient would be low, moderate, or high sepsis risk. In order to do this we had to feature 
                        engineer and create variables that are good features to predict whether a patient has sepsis. The variables we use are hours in hospital, temperature, blood pressure, 
                        heart rate, and subgroup. We split up the sofa score, which is a method to predict sepsis risk 10 being high and 1 being low, into three different bins and predicted accordingly. 
                        The basic random forest model returned a 66% accuracy.

                        <h1 class="text-1xl text-left font-bold">Dashboard</h1> <br>
                        We developed an interactive web dashboard to present our findings from our analyses. This web application was constructed using HTML, TailwindCSS, D3, and Javascript. 
                        This dashboard aims to present subgroup-based sepsis risk information in an easily digestible manner for all levels of medical staff. Currently, the web page consists of 
                        three pages: Subgroups, Sepsis Risk, and About, with an Index landing page.
                        Upon entering the webpage, the user will be presented with three colored buttons that represent the three categories we decided on categorizing patients into: green, yellow, and red. 
                        Clicking one of the buttons reveals a list of patients in the MIMIC III dataset that were grouped into those categories by our machine learning methods. Clicking on one of those revealed 
                        patients takes the user to the dashboard that displays specific information
